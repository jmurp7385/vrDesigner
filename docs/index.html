      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
      The app would be a photoshop/adobe XD like app but will be accessed through a 
      VR headset and Kinect. It allows users to edit pictures and design apps using 
      their hands to move, resize, and edit different aspects of an image or app 
      workflow. To use the app the user would need an Kinect ($99) and either google
      cardboard ($15-$30) or Samsung Gear VR ($50). The Kinect would track the users 
      body movements and allow them to control their design with their hands. The app 
      could be used in school art classes as a new medium for creating artwork. It would 
      provide a more active and immersive experience for students. Also with using more cost 
      friendly solutions to create the app it wouldnâ€™t be out of the questions to get multiple 
      stations. It is also much for cost friendly for at home user. Also many kids theses 
      days have a Kinect already if they or their parents have an Xbox product. Potentially 
      we could make it so their could be multiple users using the same Kinect to work on the 
      same photo or app flow.
