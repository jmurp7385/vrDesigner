            Hailing from Birmingham, Alabama, Adam is currently a student at
            The University of Alabama pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
            His interests in relation to software are Python development, Java
            development, and game design. When Adam isn't hacking away in Python
            or Java, he enjoys trying new craft beer, finding a new television
            show to binge, learning about new technology, or finding a new science
            fiction novel to delve into.

            I was born and raised in Hillsboro, Oregon where I grew up
            living and working on our family farm. I enlisted in the Army
            at the age of 20 and served as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal
            Technician for 5 years. After completing my contract, I continued
            my college education at The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa,
            Alabama. I have been married to my wife, Catrina, since January
            of 2014 and together we are raising our first son, Liam, who was
            born in February of 2017. I enjoy watching movies, listening to
            music, and building things using microcontrollers.
